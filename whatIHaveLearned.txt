Throughout the duration of this project, I had a great time learning the ins and outs of prolog. At first I was very nervous about how quickly I would be able to pick it up, however it didnt take at all as long as I expected. I was able to learn about how to manipulate simple declared facts and build a much larger web of information, eventually being able to step through an entire family tree. I look forward to continuing to play with the features of prolog and continue to develop skills.
